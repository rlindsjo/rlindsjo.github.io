title: Getting the Shoes On
---

I have never taken the time to write blog posts. I hardly even comment on the blogs I do read. Articulating thoughts in a manner that is both concise and entertaining to read seems hard. And who am I to think that my random thoughts are relevant to other people? But what if they are relevant or at least can serve as a function for me to collect my thought on various subjects and as a reminder as time passes by?

I'll give it a try and maybe it is just like running, once the shoes are tied and I step outside the front door it is a pleasure. But oh the effort needed to get started. Maybe this site will flourish and even be useful to others. Or it will stay silent, gather dust and be yet another project that seemed like a good idea but never really took off.

Only time will tell, but now the shoes are on, I'm standing outside the front door and there are so many interesting trails to choose from.
