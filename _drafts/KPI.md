I'm not sure I have seen a concept creating so many problems as KPI. I mean, is should be great shouldn't it? You want to improve the performance of something so you define a (or usually a selection of) KPI. Just listen to it, KPI. Key. Performance. Indicator. Not only an indicator of performance, but a **key** indicator of performance.

And so the game of defining KPIs begin. Say we develop software there are probably a whole bunch of KPIs we can come up with that could indicate how well we are doing. Here are some from the top of my mind (all taken from actual real life situations)

* Release on time
* No more than X major bugs
* Support handled in Y amount of time

You can probably continue the list to include a whole bunch more but let's start with these. Of course we want to release software when expected, not have too many major problems using it and when a user of the software does have a problem we (usually) want to work with them to resolve it swiftly. If releases get major delays, there are huge amounts of major bugs or user problems are ignored that is a problem and an indicator of that something is wrong. Notice that I said they are _indicators_ of problems, perhaps not the actual problem themselves. Say we do have late releases, a whole bunch of major bugs and user support is abysmal what should we do about it?

We will define KPIs of things easy to measure and of course we should improve those numbers. From now on releases will be on time, There will be no more than three (or whatever number suits you) known major bugs and user problems must be responded to within four hours (or two business days). And if that is not fulfilled there will be a reckoning (or at least no bonus). 

Since developers were just spitefully writing bad code slowly and support enjoyed ignoring requests we will now see them get a grip, keeping deadlines, checking their code and responding to customers promptly. And when that happens the KPIs will show that we are steadily making progress.

Ha, did you actually believe that? Developers and support are usually pretty cleaver people and they can deduceow to maximize their scor playing games and now they will start playing their end of the KPI game. You can be sure the numbers will improve, reports wil be generated and bonuses will be paid out. However, the releases will not actually be on time, there will be releases, on time, but perhaps not containing everything that was planned. And bugs will be kept to a minimum (none reported internally, and after a triage, the problem will corrupting customer database is probably just a minor annoyance). And support will respond quickly, with "needs more information", "try restart", "update to latest version", any delays are now due to the customer, and that is out of supports control.
